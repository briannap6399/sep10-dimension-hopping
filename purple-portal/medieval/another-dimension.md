 # Go to Another Dimension
#### `You have chosen to Go to Another Dimension.`

You go back to the alley you came from and notice the portal is still open. As you go through it you see outer space or at least it seems like you're traveling through space. Before you know it you fall into another dimension as you get back on your feet you notice you're at a forest, at least in front of a forest, at the other side you see a castle and villages.
You fell into a medieval fantasy world. Where are you going next?
