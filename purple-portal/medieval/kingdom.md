 # Go to the Kingdom.
#### `You have Chosen to Go to the Kingdom.`

As you walk away from the forest and closer to the kingdom you start to admire the scenery. There's a bridge to enter the kingdom, the castle seems to be above the kingdom in a mountain which seems straight out of a fairytale. As you cross the bridge you enter a small village in which there are vendors in the streets, and carriages being pulled by horses. As you continue walking you see a tall building that seems like a small castle with the words ***“Magic Academy”*** written on top, and behind the building you see another portal similar to the previous one. This could be your chance to go home or to stay. What will you do?
