# Go Further into the Forest.
#### `You have Chosen to Go Further into the Forest.`

You turn and start walking towards the forest, as you enter you admire the surroundings. The trees were taller than any other building you've seen, with a beautiful shade of green and with the sun the leaves seemed to be glowing. You keep walking and eventually you find a small house that was made completely of wood which almost seemed like a cabin. However, it's alone, abandoned, having nowhere else to go. You stay there, and being unable to return to your dimension you stay in the forest. This is the end of the journey. I hope you enjoy the beautiful nature of this world.

Thank you for completing this adventure.
