# Grab the Watch.
#### `You have Chosen to Grab the Watch.`

You reach out to grab the watch, you are feet away from touching the ground but before you do a portal opens and you return back to your original dimension safely on the ground. The watch is now gone, no longer in your hands.

Thank you for completing this adventure.
