# Stay to watch
#### `You have Chosen to Stay and Watch the Fight.`

As everyone screams and runs away from a certain direction on your left, you start walking towards that
direction. As you get closer you now fully notice the 2 people fighting one flying in the air, the other on an
opposite rooftop. As you stand there watching them fight you notice the one flying is protecting the civilians
with a golden force field shielding the civilians, while shooting light beams at the person on the rooftop.You
notice the person on the rooftop calm and composed despite the energy beams being aimed at them and the chaos that surrounds them. The light beams vanish as soon as they meet with a dark wall or fog, it looks like a
shadow. Dark shadow vine comes out of the person as they stare down at the chaos on the street only then you
realize that person is you.
What will you do next?
