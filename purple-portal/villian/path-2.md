# Path 2.
#### `You have Chosen Path 2.`

You decide to take the second path and as you continue to walk you notice something glowing, as you search from where it's coming you realize it's coming from your hand. You're wearing a watch that you had never seen before and it was glowing, before you could get the chance to take it off you were back. Back in your house, your room, your world.

Thank you for completing this adventure.
