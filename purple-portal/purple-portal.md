# Purple Portal.
#### `You have chosen the purple portal.`
You chose to go through the purple portal, you soon find yourself in an alley, as you leave the alley and continue walking you realize the world seems the same as your own except it's more advanced. You notice everyone running away from the same direction as you turn to see what they're running from, it turns out a superhero is fighting a villian. What will you do next?
