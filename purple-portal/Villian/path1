# Path 1
## You have chosen path 1

As you continue walking you notice someone in front of you, it's you!? It's the other version of you, that you
saw on the rooftop earlier fighting the hero. They look at you, no surprise in their expression rather
amusement. Before you have time to react the shadow lines block your vision.
Once you open your eyes you realize your back home, in your dimension.

Thank you for completing this adventure.
