## Name: `Dimension F@LL`.
### Date of 'Creation':`N/A.`
### General Information: `Dimension F@LL seems to follow a 'Bottomless-Pit' Structure, with the only difference being that the 'Pit' part is replaced with the Sky. Upon a Traveler entering this Dimension, they seem to fall for long periods of time, with the end of the fall being mostly unknown. Judging by recent cases however, the end of the fall seemingly leads to the Travelers 'Waking-Up' in their bedroom, specifically in their Home Dimension. (Note, by 'Home Dimension', the log means the Dimension that the person originated from, not Dimension H0M3.)`
### Safety Level for New Encounters: `2; Pretty Safe, but still mostly unknown.`
