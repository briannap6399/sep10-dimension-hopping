## The Glass Inventor.

Considering the fact you don’t know what the Picture Frame’s Gadgets do, you choose to knock on their door. The Blowtorch Process would continue on for a bit longer, until the Picture Frame removed their mask and opened the door, displaying an irritated expression on her face. You’re admittedly taken aback by how she looked, given the fact that she was near human sized, and had black and white lines for eyes, but you take a deep breath and apologize for your intrusion. You also explain to her your situation, and seeing how she’s been able to create so many gadgets, ask for her help to send you back home. The Picture Frame seemed skeptical at first, but hesitantly offered you her services. You were then ushered into the room she came from, revealing a ginormous room filled with Lab Experiments, Hardware Tools, Blueprints, and more Gadgets. It was like some Mad Scientist Lab you’d see in a Sci-Fi film.. Anyways, the Picture Frame would then explain to you that she’s been trying to find a way to reach other Dimensions, and since you are a living example of ‘Trans-Dimensional Accessing’, you can help her as well! You just have to help her build a Portal Spawner, and she’ll send you home. Admittedly, it’s clear that she surpasses you in intelligence, but the least you can do is help her make the Spawner.. Right?
