'Spirit-Guider'.

That Warehouse just looks too suspicious.. You turn around and start rushing through the city’s streets, trying to find at least an awning to stand under as the rainfall grows to be more heavy. You continue to rush, as your body gets seriously drenched, until you hear a soft call for you in an alleyway.. You turn towards the alleyway, as you hear the call once again, and without much thinking, rush towards it, praying it’s someone that wants to help, and not someone who’s going to kill you. To your relief, you only find a woman sitting inside a shabby looking shack. You hesitate, before entering the shack and looking over at the woman, who seemed to be a Broken Moon Necklace with a Star Charm.. She softly greets you by name- Wait.. How does she do that? You are left confused by the woman, who softly giggled at your confusion. She reveals to you that she has been watching you since you had first appeared in this dimension, as well as the fact she has.. Certain Supernatural Powers. Admittedly, you are left creeped out by her words, yet you can’t help but be curious… If she’s truly a psychic, would she be able to read your fortune? You could ask her to give you a fortune telling, or simply call her for her bluff; What do you think is best?
