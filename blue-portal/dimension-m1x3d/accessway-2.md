## Dimension M1X3D.

Welcome to Dimension M1X3D! So far, it doesn’t seem that bad.. Sure the streets are a little empty, but the city is absolutely gigantic and filled with lights! It even looks surprisingly clean.. You start to walk through the streets, carefully avoiding the very few object pedestrians that seem not too bothered by your presence. Along the way, you learned that the city is called Umbrea, and instead of the Statue of Liberty, there’s a ‘Statue of Torch’! You walked for a bit longer, by now reaching the Outskirts of Umbrea, before feeling a giant rain droplet smack into your head. Then another, and another.. It’s raining! You immediately try to look around for any shelter, only to see a faintly lit Warehouse about 300 Feet from where you are now. From the looks of it however, the Warehouse looks a little abandoned.. Do you risk heading to the Abandoned Warehouse, or do you try to turn back around, hoping to find some shelter from the ‘Teardrop Family Reunion’?
