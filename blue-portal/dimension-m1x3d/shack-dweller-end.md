## Ending 9/10 (Bri's Path): Shack Dweller.

You approach the Portal, watching as it continues to flicker and fade.. This could be your only shot back home, but something about it seems wrong, too wrong to even risk your life for it. You ultimately decide to back up, with the Portal closing in on itself, and disappearing. Where did it lead? You will never know, but for now, you are trapped in Dimension M1X3D. The Broken Moon Necklace would approach you slowly and place one of her hands on your shoulder, silently telling you that things will be alright..  You 2 would remain silent for a brief moment, until the woman broke the silence, letting you know that her name is Orchid, and given your situation, she’ll allow you to live in her shack alongside her, at least.. Until you 2 find a new Portal for you to leave with. A small smile would appear on your face, and you would accept her offer, allowing her to escort you back to her shabby looking shack. It’ll be a bit cramped with the 2 of you there together, but at least you’re with someone you can trust for the time being. Plus, who knows: You might find a new Portal within a week or 2, or.. You know what? Let’s not think about that or for now. Just focus on making sure you and Orchid aren’t harmed by the unknowns of this world…
