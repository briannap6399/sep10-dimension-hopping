    Ending 8/10 (Bri's Path): The Tortured Souls Department.

This has to be fake. It just has to! You quickly got from where you sat, and outright told the lady that she should try to seek some psychological help, because no one sane would obviously have psychic abilities. The Broken Moon Necklace lady looked deeply hurt by the comment, but.. Didn’t say anything? Instead, she rose up from where she sat, and before you could react, placed one of her hands on your shoulder. She still didn’t say anything to you, but you could faintly hear her mumbling something.. You start to look terrified as you realize she is speaking in Latin, and upon letting go, your vision gets clouded. You try to back out of the woman’s shack, but you start hearing all of these whispers and yells.. You even feel shivers go down your spine, as you start seeing spirits all around you, laughing and mocking you for your stupidity. In your world, there might not be anyone who has psychic abilities, but you aren’t in your world right now.. The whispers, laughs and yells got louder, and your body started shaking violently. Pure Fear would start to set in as you realized you were trapped in your position. You can faintly see the Moon Necklace looking over at you, with pity in her visible eye.. She wanted to help you, but if you didn’t trust her.. What’s the point of helping an already gone soul?
