## The Blue Portal.

After taking the time to consider your options, you choose to enter The Blue Portal. Afterall, Blue is typically safer than Red in a lot of movies, so it has to be safer than the Purple Portal! As soon as you enter The Blue Portal, you suddenly feel weightless, and you find yourself propelled into a big stream, one that you seemingly can’t escape from. You look around, noting that you can see several different Planets and Stars passing you by, leaving you amazed.. A few more minutes would pass as you continued to ride the Space Stream, and in the distance you can see 2 Glowing Lights in the distance. When you get closer to the Lights, you can see that they both are unique accessways, and lead to different areas. The 1st Accessway allows you to see Ancient Temples, Gorgons, and a Giant Mountain, one that seems to be topped with several glowing beings.. It seems strange, so you look towards the 2nd Accessway. It contains a more city-like landscape, resembling New York City, but it looks like every single citizen are Inanimate Objects brought to life! That seems even more weird compared to the 1st Accessway, but you’re getting even closer to the 2 Accessways. It’s clear you’ll have to choose between the 2. Which Accessway do you enter?
