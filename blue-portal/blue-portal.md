## The Blue Portal.

Upon entering the Blue Portal, you start traveling through what seems like Outer Space! After all, you do pass by various Planets and Dwarf Planets, some you might not even know the name of. But that’s not the big issue. What is however, is that you only see 2 Different Ways to exit the Portal’s Stream. These are called Accessways. Both Accessways give you a glimpse at the Dimension they lead to, and they certainly look.. Interesting. Within the 1st Accessway, you see Mythical Creatures such as Gorgons and Harpies. You can even make out a gigantic mountain in the distance.. Within the 2nd Accessway, you see a city that looks really similar to Bangkok, Thailand, but all of its residents seem to take on the form of Objects? Which Accessway do you choose? Hurry, before you pass them!
