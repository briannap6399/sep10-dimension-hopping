 ## Dimension MYTH1C@L.

Welcome to Dimension MYTH1C@L! You are pushed right into action, as you land inside a Gorgon Den. Thankfully, you paid attention to your classes on Greek Mythology, and you already know what a Gorgon can do if you are spotted by one. (You will turn to stone) You look around, and see 2 Enchanted Items: A Gigantic Hero’s Blade, one that could clearly decapitate a Gorgon with the right user, and a Mirror, one that would break the laws of fantasy and even let a vampire see themselves. You only have time to pick 1 of the 2 items to use before you are spotted, so which will you pick up?
