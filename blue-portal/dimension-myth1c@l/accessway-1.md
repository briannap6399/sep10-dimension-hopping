 ## Dimension MYTH1C@L.

Welcome to Dimension MYTH1C@L! You feel a little bit dazed, but upon recovering from the sudden transportation, you realize that you were teleported into a big Gorgon’s Den. How do you know this is a Gorgon’s Den? You can see several broken statues on the ground, all with decapitated heads.. Regardless, you are terrified. From what you can remember from the Greek Culture Course in your High School, you remember countless stories about a Gorgon named Medusa, and how she could turn anyone to stone, upon looking into her eyes. At least you have an idea on how to fight off a Gorgon, but to your relief, you can see 2 Items hidden behind some Rocks; 1 of them was a gigantic Hero’s Blade, with Greek Symbols chiseled into its handle and a super sharp blade, perfect for piercing through Gorgons. The other one meanwhile was an Enchanted Mirror. From what you can tell from it, its reflective capabilities are so strong, that maybe even a Vampire could see their own reflection.. You can’t admire the 2 Items for long however, as you do not know when a Gorgon will emerge from Slumber. Which item do you take; The Hero’s Blade, or the Enchanted Mirror?
