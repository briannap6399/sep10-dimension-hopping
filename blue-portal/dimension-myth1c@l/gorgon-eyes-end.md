 ### Ending 1/10 (Bri's Path): Gorgon’s Eyes.

With little time to spare, you choose the Hero’s Blade, thinking that you will be able to wield it, similar to how other warriors have been able to do it in several bits of media. However, you are not a warrior. A Gorgon slithers from her chamber, and immediately spots you. As soon as you raise the Blade over your head, the Gorgon’s Magic takes effect.

The Gorgon now uses you as furniture, alongside several other foolish people who thought they could take down a Gorgon with a Blade.
