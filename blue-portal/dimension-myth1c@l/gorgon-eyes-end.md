 ## Ending 1/10 (Bri's Path): Gorgon’s Eyes.

With little time to spare, you choose the Hero’s Blade, thinking that you will be able to wield it, similar to how other warriors have been able to do it in several bits of media. However, you are not a powerful warrior. Within a few moments, a Gorgon would start to slither from her chambers, clearly looking as if she just woke up from a long bit of slumber. You didn’t give her much time to really wake up, as you started to charge her, yelling out some sort of battle cry as you raised the Hero’s Blade above your head. However, you couldn’t even land a graze on her, as her snake’s tail suddenly wrapped around your waist, trapping you in place. Anger was in her eyes, as she locked gazes with you, quickly starting to turn your body into stone. You tried to slash your way out of her tail’s grip, but your organs were quickly overwhelmed by the petrification, causing them to give out, and letting you die, just as you became a statue. The Gorgon would hiss, before dropping your body, letting your head break from your body, and roll towards other decapitated statue heads, who all thought they could kill a Gorgon with the Hero’s Blade, and without any experience with combat.
