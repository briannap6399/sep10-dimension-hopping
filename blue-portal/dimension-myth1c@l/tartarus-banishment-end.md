 ## Ending 3B/10: Banished to Tartarus.

You weigh your options, and decide that maybe it’s best you try and ‘convince’ Hera to help you. After all, Zeus is pretty short tempered and can be.. Quite Provocative. You take a deep breath and slip through the Olympus Gates, with several gods and goddesses looking your way. You try to look confident as you make your way towards the Goddess, but internally, you’re a horrified wreck. With no possible way of turning back, you first try to ask Hera to help you get back home, before leaving a subtle flirt in your conclusion. Unfortunately for you however, Hera has even less of a short temper than Zeus, and the fact a mortal tried to seduce her.. How disgusting! You realize all too late that you made the wrong decision, and before you can apologize for your foolish sentence, several glowing chains wrap around your legs, and you are dragged down the mountain, and even through Earth’s Crust. Dazed and Terrified, you now find yourself in the worst pits of Tartarus, where you are immediately sent into your punishment; Climbing Up a Steep Mountain with a Heavy Gorgon Statue strapped to your Back, only to lose your grip and tumble back down the Mountain, with your body getting more scraped and injured every time you take the tumble, all for eternity. At least you can use this time to rethink your previous actions in life..
