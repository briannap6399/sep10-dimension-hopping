## Ending 2/10 (Bri's Path): Co-Op Mode.

The Ruler was ecstatic to see that you chose the riches, and eagerly gave you a room alongside their own. Unbeknownst to you however, The Ruler had more in mind for you than what you were originally told. Upon waking up the next day, you realize that your clothing was gone, but instead replaced with expensive silk, and even.. A Royal Scepter? Congratulations! It seems The Ruler has seen your potential, and has decided to make you a Ruler as well. You 2 will now Rule the Kingdom equally, but at the cost of you never heading back home. Hope youâ€™re a good Ruler, your Highness! Actually, you might **already** be a Good Ruler..
