## Riches or Devotion?

You should pat yourself on the back! You picked up the mirror, and as the Gorgon spotted you, raised the mirror in front of your body. As soon as the Gorgon tried to use her magic on you, the mirror would reflect the magic onto the Gorgon, immediately turning her into stone. However, it seems a common villager had spotted you taking down the Gorgon and had reported you to their Local Ruler. The Ruler would send some guards to bring you to their palace, and upon seeing them, you look a little confused, as they look a little bit like you... Anyways, they thank you handsomely for your work, and offer you a gigantic clay vase filled with gold and riches! As the Ruler keeps talking, you see a stained glass take the place of a mirror. The mirror seems to depict 3 Gigantic Gods right behind the mountain you had seen earlier. It seems that they are worshipped by the people, and the ruler! You ask about the Stained Glass, and the Ruler happily lets you know about the Gods, with you realizing they are Zeus, Poseidon and Hades! Now, you are presented with 2 Options: You could keep the already given riches, or you could try and seek out the Gods, using your riches and hoping they will send you back to your own Dimension. What do you do?
