## 2 Unique Portals.

Oh No! It seems that your luck has run out! After Touring a Laboratory, you accidentally stumble through a Forbidden Section, and fall through the Section’s Flooring, revealing an ancient Portal Room. After looking around, you noticed that all but 2 Portals have been disabled. Due to how high you fell, it’s clear that you will not be able to go back up from where you came, meaning you’ll have to enter a portal. The 1st Portal you see has a Purple Frame, while the 2nd Portal has a Blue Frame. You cannot tell which Portal is safer, and there are no signs of where each Portal leads. Which Portal do you pick to enter?
